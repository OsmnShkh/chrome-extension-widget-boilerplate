**This project is a built upon [this](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react) boilerplate.**

### I've made the following changes as per my requirement:

- Removed the NewTab configs from `webpack.config.js`
- Add `src/App` that contains the widget that'll appear on bottom-right on allowed pages
- It's embedded inside an iframe, on `src/Content/index.js`

Thanks
